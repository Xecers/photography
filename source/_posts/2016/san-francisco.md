      When was the last time you waited on the pavement during 10 minutes,
      for good lighting conditions?

      I remember tourists taking selfies in front of the cathedral while I was turning my back to them, to snap another kind of edifice.

      They even aligned the *Sutro Tower* with the main road.

I loved *San Francisco* and it has been a big surprise to me: it is like London by the [Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean), more hilly and as enjoyable by foot, bike or bus.
