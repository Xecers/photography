      My first encounter with the venitian lights. They are so warm in winterâ€¦


      I remember this sentiment of peace as we walk, randomly, in the nearly
      empty streets.

      Everything looks beautiful. We bump on tourists only right now â€” they have not disappeared after all.

      The sunset stroke our eyes with a long and powerful pyrotechnic show. Although there is still a long wait to go before jumping into a new year.

      Slow start for the new year.

      I feel blessed again by the warmth of the sunsetting disc of lights. It gives an even deeper intensity to the turquoise colour of the canals.

First trip in Italy. First holidays together. And a second New Year's Eve spent by the water â€” this time not quite as quiet.
